# Notes
2139 OK! A late start for today but better late than never, after much procrastination I've decided that I'm going to commit to using the Sea Druid username, which was inspired while playing Baldur's Gate and learning about Network States and seasteading...neither of which I was familiar with

I was going to commit to getting a job, but the difference btween making $100, $50, and $25 is not really all that much. I mean $100/hr is more than double the most I've ever made ($45/hr), but from the perspective of money being a tool even $25/hr right now is not really necessary

That said, I DO have access to microwork...I can make around $6/hr on Prolific Surveys and CloudConnect, and $20-40/hr on DataAnnotation. I have been telling myself for years that if I just commit an hour or two a day that I would be golden, but I've developed terrible habits and addictions I have to overcome or at least learn to manage
