# Notes
0554 Crashed very early last night, I had drank 4 beers in about 1.5hrs which made me pretty toasty, I basically have no memory of watching YouTube last night despite my history showing that I watched hours worth lol I mean I shouldn't laugh, really I need to grow past this...

One of my first thoughts when I woke up was "man it would be nice to have an edible right now" but really I want to wake up and be excited to work, not get high. I actually thought yesterday was Sunday, but that's today, so instead of anticipating weed/drinks I'm going to commit to a sober sunday
