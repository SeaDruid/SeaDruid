# Notes
0554 Crashed very early last night, I had drank 4 beers in about 1.5hrs which made me pretty toasty, I basically have no memory of watching YouTube last night despite my history showing that I watched hours worth lol I mean I shouldn't laugh, really I need to grow past this...

One of my first thoughts when I woke up was "man it would be nice to have an edible right now" but really I want to wake up and be excited to work, not get high. I actually thought yesterday was Sunday, but that's today, so instead of anticipating weed/drinks I'm going to commit to a sober sunday

0735 Created a Twitter @SeaDruids, but might change it to TheSeaDruid. Within minutes of being on Twitter I found loads of inspiring links

0838 OK! I'm going to commit to using @SeaDruids X as a filesystem for an LLM OS...I probably won't do my dailies in here anymore and instead use X

1146 OK all emails have been marked read, still need to go through and extract any info especially regarding AI news
